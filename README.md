# Commodity-Prices
As part of my journey in Data Anlysis with Python, I decided to take up a little challenge.
## Data Source
Commodity Prices data was downloade from the Ghana [StatsBank](https://statsbank.statsghana.gov.gh/index.html) database. The data comprise of prices of commodies (Cocoa, Diseal, Oil, Peterol, and Gold) from January 2000 to April 2023.
Data was dowloaded in json format
## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to get the annual price of each commodity in the past five years (ie. 2018 to 2022) 
## Tech stack
